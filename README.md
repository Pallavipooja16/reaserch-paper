## COVID VACCINES
# If you're wondering which vaccine to take takes whichever's available.
# Here some information about the 2vaccines: 1. COVISHIELD and 2. COVAXIN 
# COVAXIN (BBV152) is an inactivated SARS-COV-2 virus vaccine, whereas COVISHIELD (chAdOx1) is a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine. 
# Okay now What exactly these fancy terms mean?
# 1. COVAXIN(BBV152) uses inactivated virus approach. 
When you get covaxin, you are basically getting injected with actual SARS-COV-2 virus particles which are inactivated. 
Its like jadoo striped away all the powers which he gave to Rohit and as result Rohit becomes powerless.
An inactivated virus won't cause an infection in your body, its basically powerless. But it will do one thing i.e., help our body make SARS-COV-2 specific antibodies.
The mechanism of an inactivated virus is simple i.e., When COVAXIN is administered, the T-CELLS and B-CELLS detect the inactivated virus particles.
T-CELLS are responsible for producing memory T-cells that remember the virus and B-cells are responsible for producing virus specific antibodies. Basically, preparing our body for future infection. we can say T-CELLS and B-CELLS worked well.
#COVISHIELD uses chimpanzee adeno virus approach.
When you get covishield, you dont get injected to actual SARS-COV-2 virus but you instead get injected with an adeno virus that infects chimpanzee. 
Adeno virus which is used in covishield vaccine is specific strain of virus that causes running nose in chimpanzee.
How does adeno virus approach work?
Adeno virus used in COVIDSHIELD is modified to carry a corona virus gene. When COVISHIELD is administered, the adeno virus enters the living cell and the modified gene instruct the cell to produce SARS-CO-2 spike proteins and display it on the surface of the cell.
These spike proteins are then detected by the T-CELLS and B-CELLS and our body starts building immunity.
# THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT 
COVISHIELD is using adenovirus to make the spike protein present on the surface of corona virus & COVAXIN is using actual corona virus.
# SO WHICH VACCINE WE SHOULD TAKE ?? 
Take any vaccine whichever is available. Every vaccine is good. The mechanism of vaccines may be different but they serve the same goal, minimises the chances of hospitalisation and death.
And the good news is that both the vaccines are effective against B.1.617 (DOUBLE MUTANT) variant.
## SO GO TAKE THE VACCINES. Don't believe those WhatsApp forwards. Theres nothing to worry about.
